## Problem Statements & Challenges

### SmartFarming Sense: AI-Driven Crop Intelligence

**Problem:**  
Smallholder farmers struggle to optimize yields because they lack real-time data and predictive insights about their fields.

**Challenge:**  
Build a web based chatbot that lets farmers monitor field conditions, receive AI-powered yield predictions, and get actionable recommendationsâ€”using affordable IoT sensors and AI models.

Imagine this scenario:  
Sarah, a maize farmer in rural Kenya, guesses when to irrigate and fertilize because she has no reliable way to monitor her soil or anticipate rainfall. Meanwhile, her neighbor Ali, who invested in a few low-cost sensors, still can't make sense of the data or predict his harvest.

**Your Mission:**  
Bridge the gap between raw field data and actionable, predictive insights. Transform manual, uncertain farming into data-driven, thriving agriculture.

### ðŸ§© THE PROBLEM UNIVERSE

You're not just building a dashboardâ€”you're creating a digital farm assistant that solves real pain points:

#### For Farmers:
- No real-time visibility into soil moisture, temperature, or weather
- Uncertainty about when to plant, irrigate, or harvest
- Guesswork in predicting yields and planning sales
- Lack of affordable, easy-to-use digital tools

#### For Agronomists & Cooperatives:
- Difficulty advising many farmers at scale
- No centralized data to track field performance
- Hard to recommend optimal interventions for each plot

#### For Communities:
- Low yields threaten food security and income
- Data and technology gaps drive rural-urban migration
- Missed opportunities for collective learning and growth

## Requirements

- **List the Sensors Needed:**  
  - Soil moisture
  - Soil temperature
  - Air temperature and humidity
  - Light intensity
  - Optional: Rainfall, pH, nutrient sensors

- **Propose an AI Model:**  
  - Use historical sensor and yield data to train a model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM, or simple regression) to predict crop yields for a given season/field.
  - The model should take into account weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop variety.
